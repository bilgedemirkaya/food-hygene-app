  <h2 class="title">About the Data</h2>
  <p class="content">
    The data provide the food hygiene rating or inspection result given to a
    business and reflect the standards of food hygiene found on the date of
    inspection or visit by the local authority. Businesses include restaurants,
    pubs, cafés, takeaways, hotels, and other places consumers eat, as well as
    supermarkets and other food shops. The data are held on behalf of local
    authorities participating in either the Food Standards Agency's national
    Food Hygiene Rating Scheme (FHRS) in England, Northern Ireland, and Wales,
    or the Food Hygiene Information Scheme (FHIS) in Scotland. Data are only
    available for local authority areas running either of these schemes. See a
    list of local authorities running the FHRS or FHIS.
